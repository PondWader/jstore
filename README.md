# JStore

> ⚠️ This project is an experimental data store implementation for fun and **not** designed to be used in production or for any serious project! ⚠️

A W.I.P self-optimising persistent data store for storing and retrieving JavaScript objects in Node.js. The idea is that data will automatically be indexed and cached based on query profiling. The aim is to also make it [ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID) compliant.
